This is an implementation of a shell program I wrote for my Operating Systems course at college. It can execute commands found in path as well as redirecting the output into requested files. It can also schdeule commands to be run it the background. You can also create aliases in this shell program. It was overall a good project for practising system functions such as fork/exec, dup2, etc.

There is a special command called 'bello' that displays some information about the system.

To run:
> make
> ./myshell
